The Polar Form is used when describing a [[Complex Numbers|Complex Number]] with Angles, and to do that, the main things you need are:
>- The [[Absolute Value|Magnitude]] $r$ of the [[Complex Numbers|Complex Number]].
>- And the angle $\theta$ (which can also be called argument) formed from the positive [[Real Number Line|Real Axis]] to the where the [[Complex Numbers|Complex Number]] is.

>[!todo] Conversion to the Rectangular Form
>The [[Polar]] Form can be converted into the Rectangular Form by separating its parts into a Real, Horizontal, part $r \cos\theta$ and then an Imaginary, Vertical, part $r \sin\theta\cdot i$
